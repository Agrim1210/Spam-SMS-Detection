# SMS Spam Detection System
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Here the messages are in the human-readable language which computer can't understand, so we have to use the NLP to make it possible for computers to read human (natural) language SMS and determine which parts are important.

So, Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language.

NLP makes it possible for computers to read the text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

The input and output of an NLP system can be âˆ’  
Speech  
Written Text

Model for classifying the Email/SMS into Spam or Ham through the text of Email/SMS using standard classifiers.

Considering overall performance of Precision and Accuracy  
Since NB has the best Accuracy and Precision, Naive Bayes is the model.
